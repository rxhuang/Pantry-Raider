Introduction 
Everyone wants to eat good food but cooking good food can be a challenge. Not everyone wants to try to cook something new only for it to turn out to be inedible. Recipes can be a godsend in helping the culinary-challenged cook good food. But, the next question is: what food can I make? With Pantry Raider, you can log ingredients to your “pantry” and the app will find recipes that most closely match the ingredients that you have. Now, you can find a recipe that you like, follow the directions, and cook delicious food without having to stop by the store for more ingredients!
